# Arithmos _αριθμός_

Arithmos is a set of APIs that target different taxonomies of algorithms to solve problems through providing _algorithm generic utilities_, and several implementations for the common _abstract data types (adt)_ commonly encountered during solving problems while building commericial applications or participating in problem solving contests.

Arithmos is essentially composed of the following:
- [x] Vector2d Library (Finished).
- [ ] Vector3d Library.
- [ ] MatrixNd Library.
- [ ] Discrete Sets Operations (Conjunctive, Disjunctive, Subtraction, Powersets, De'Morgans formulas).
- [ ] Physics Simulation Library (Collision detection - Force Control - Objects interactions).
- [ ] Statistics Algoritms Library (Present in Java - WIP to port).
- [ ] Differential and Integral Calculus Library.
- [ ] Generic Algorithms Utilities Library.
- [ ] Linear Algorithms Library.
- [ ] Graph Algorithms Library.
- [ ] Memory Algorithms Library.
- [ ] Database Algorithms Library.
- [ ] Cryptology Algorithms Library.

Most of these libraries rely on the _Generic Algorithms Utilities Library_; this was studied as a way to build abstractions using constructs commonly known as "Designation". When designation and ontology are combined, the result is a very powerful combinatoric, that is formulated as _A Set of all possible common constructs among the objects in examination._

> [!NOTE]
>
> _Designation_ is assigning _constructs_ from a _Constructs Set_ to an object > from the _Object Set_, while _Denotation_
